# Number options

Formatter options let you customize number formatting to suit your needs. They include:

- [Presentation options](presentation-options.md): Adjust visual formatting.
- [Unit and currency options](unit-and-currency-options.md): Format units and currencies.
- [Digit options](digit-options.md): Control precision and rounding.

::: info NOTE

Most of these options are derived from the [`Intl.NumberFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat) API, which provides a robust way to format numbers in JavaScript based on locale and formatting preferences.
