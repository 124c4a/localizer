# Formatter options

Formatter options enable you to tailor formatters to meet specific requirements. These options are organized into several categories:

- [Presets](presets.md): Specify which commonly used date and time formats to use.
- [Date and time component options](date-time-component-options.md): Configure exact representation of formatted values.
- [Presentation options](presentation-options.md): Define how values are visually presented.

::: info NOTE

Most of these options are derived from the [`Intl.DateTimeFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat) API, which provides a robust way to format dates and times in JavaScript based on locale and formatting preferences.
