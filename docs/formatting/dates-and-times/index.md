# Formatting dates and times

The **@localizer** library offers tools for precise and flexible date and time formatting.

- [Date/time](./date-time.md)
- [Date/time range](./date-time-range.md)

All formatters support [configuration options](./options/index.md) to customize their behavior for specific use cases.
