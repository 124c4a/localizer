# Formatting dates and times

The **@localizer** library provides a robust set of formatters for formatting and managing date and time values with precision and flexibility.

- [Date/time](./date-time.md)
- [Date/time range](./date-time-range.md)

All formatters support [configuration options](./options/index.md), enabling you to customize their behavior to suit specific use cases effectively.
