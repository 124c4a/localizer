# Formatter options

Formatter options enable you to tailor formatters to meet specific requirements. These options are organized into several categories:

- [Digit options](digit-options.md): Manage precision and rounding for formatted values.
- [Presentation options](presentation-options.md): Define how values are visually presented.
- [Unit and currency options](unit-and-currency-options.md): Specify the representation of measurement units and currencies in the output.

::: info NOTE

Most of these options are derived from the [`Intl.NumberFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat) API, which provides a robust way to format numbers in JavaScript based on locale and formatting preferences.
