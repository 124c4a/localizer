# Translation

Translation support is a cornerstone of any effective localization library, and **@localizer** excels in this area.

Currently, the library provides [native translation support for TypeScript](./native-translation.md). This functionality is built upon [localizable types](../introduction/localizable.md) and [value formatting](../formatting/index.md), ensuring smooth and efficient integration with TypeScript-based projects.
