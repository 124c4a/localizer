# Translation

Translation support is a cornerstone of any effective localization library, and **@localizer** excels in this area. The library provides two primitives for dealing with translations:

- [Translation maps](./translation-map.md), that provide a straightforward way of representing single `Localizable` values.
- [Dictionaries](./dictionary.md), enabling usage of complete dictionaries with built-in support for lazy loading of translations.
