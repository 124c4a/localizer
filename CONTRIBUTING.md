- feat - Introduces new features or improvements (e.g., adding support for new formats).
- fix - Resolves bugs or incorrect behavior (e.g., fixing edge cases in formatters).
- cleanup - Refactors or improves code without user-facing changes (e.g., reorganizing utility functions).
- chore - Updates project dependencies or configurations with no user impact (e.g., upgrading build tools).

##### Scope

The scope must be one of the following:

- core - Core functionality
- format - Data formatting
- transform - Data transformations
- translate - Translations

##### Subject and Body

The subject should briefly describe the change. The body provides additional context, such as implementation details or reasons for the change.

Reference related issues using keywords like `Closes #<issue-number>` to link the PR to an issue.

For breaking changes, include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` section in the body to explain the impact and migration steps.
